# Total Order Discount+

The Total Order Discount+ extension is for CMS Opencart 3. It allows to make a discount system based on sub-total price or products amount in the cart.

The extension has been tested with OC 3.0.2.0 and default template, but should work with other OC 3.x and default-compatable templates and can be easily modified for newer OC versions and custom templates.
